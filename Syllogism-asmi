# 🧾 **SYLLOGISM – QUICK REVISION NOTES**

---

## 💡 1. What is Syllogism?

A reasoning method that tests whether **conclusions logically follow** from the given **statements (premises)** using logical relationships like *All, Some, No, Some not, Only,* etc.

## 🧩 2. Key Relationship Words & Meanings

| Keyword              | Meaning                       | Venn Relation       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **All A are B**      | A is completely inside B      | A ⊂ B               |
| **Some A are B**     | A and B partially overlap     | A ∩ B ≠ ∅           |
| **No A is B**        | A and B don’t overlap         | A ∩ B = ∅           |
| **Some A are not B** | Part of A outside B           | Partial non-overlap |
| **Only A are B**     | All B are A                   | B ⊂ A               |
| **Few A are B**      | Some overlap (same as “Some”) | A ∩ B ≠ ∅           |

## ⚙️ 3. Basic Combination Rules (for direct conclusions)

| Statements                     | Direct Conclusion            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| All A are B + All B are C      | → All A are C & Some C are A |
| All A are B + Some B are C     | → Some A are C (Possible)    |
| Some A are B + All B are C     | → Some A are C               |
| No A is B + All B are C        | → Some C are not A           |
| Some A are not B + All B are C | → Some A are not C           |

## 🌈 4. Possibility in Syllogism

### 🔹 **Definition:**

A *possibility conclusion* checks whether something **can** be true — i.e., **no statement blocks it**.

### ✅ **Possibility follows when:**

* No **negative statement** (No / Not / Some not) blocks it.
* There’s **no contradiction** to the assumed overlap.

### ❌ **Possibility does NOT follow when:**

* Any “No” or “Some not” exists between those terms.
* It **contradicts** the given relation.

---

### 📘 **Examples**

| Statements                | Possibility Conclusion                | Result           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| All cars are vehicles     | All vehicles being cars possible      | ✅ Follows        |
| No fruit is vegetable     | Some vegetables being fruits possible | ❌ Doesn’t follow |
| Some pens are not pencils | All pencils being pens possible       | ❌ Doesn’t follow |
| All roses are flowers     | All flowers being roses possible      | ✅ Follows        |

---

### 🪄 **Golden Rule for Possibility:**

> ✅ “If not denied, it’s possible.”
> ❌ “If restricted by ‘No’ or ‘Not’, it’s not possible.”

---

## ⚖️ 5. Either–Or Concept (Special Case)

### 🔸 **Used when we can’t decide exact truth but one must be true.**

### ✅ **Conditions for Either–Or:**

| Condition | Explanation                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣       | One conclusion is **positive**, the other **negative**     |
| 2️⃣       | Both involve **same subject & predicate**                  |
| 3️⃣       | Both **cannot** be true together, but **one must** be true |

---

### 🧠 **Example:**

**Statement:** Some dogs are cats.
**Conclusions:**
(i) Some dogs are cats.
(ii) Some dogs are not cats.

✅ **Either–Or follows**
Because — one must hold true in every scenario, though both can’t be true together.

---

### 🔹 **Common Either–Or Pairs**

| Pair Type                       | Either–Or Relation | Example                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Some A are B / Some A are not B | ✅ Either–Or        | Some dogs are cats / Some dogs are not cats           |
| All A are B / Some A are not B  | ✅ Either–Or        | All pens are pencils / Some pens are not pencils      |
| No A is B / Some A are B        | ✅ Either–Or        | No fruits are vegetables / Some fruits are vegetables |

## 🎯 6. Quick Venn Hints (Mental Picture)

| Case             | Diagram in Words   | Tip                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| All A are B      | A circle inside B  | No part of A outside B |
| Some A are B     | A overlaps B       | Shared area exists     |
| No A is B        | Separate circles   | 0 overlap              |
| Some A are not B | A partly outside B | Negative link present  |
| Only A are B     | B inside A         | Reverse of “All”       |

## 🧮 7. Smart Tricks for Exams

1. **Draw quick small circles** — not full diagrams, just relations.
2. **Look for negatives first** — they restrict possibility.
3. **Remember:**

   * “All” → makes big set
   * “Some not” → breaks relation
   * “Only” → reverses direction
4. **Either–Or** = positive + negative of same pair.
5. **Possibility** = allowed unless *blocked.*

## 🧾 8. Shortcut Table Summary

| Statement        | Possible Conclusion     | Follows? |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| All A are B      | All B being A possible  | ✅        |
| Some A are B     | All A being B possible  | ✅        |
| No A is B        | Some A being B possible | ❌        |
| Some A are not B | All A being B possible  | ❌        |
| Only A are B     | All B being A possible  | ✅        |

---

✅ **Quick Recap:**

* Positive statements allow **possibility**.
* Negative statements **block** possibility.
* “Either–Or” is **logical complement**, not contradiction.
* **If not denied → it’s possible.**
* **If one must be true but can’t be both → either–or applies.**
